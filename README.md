# hello-world
first repository per tutorial

I'm nervous about this, but I'm trying to figure out how to use this resource.
You might see some random class projects at first, but soon I'll apply this to research too.
Someone keeps saying "be brave enough to be kind."
That's nice.
Wish me that courage too.
